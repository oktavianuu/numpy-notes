    "For example the array of `[1, 2, 1]` has one axis. The axis has three elements. The array below is a two dimensional array, meaning that it has two axes. The first axis has the length of two, the second axis has the element of three. "

    "### ndarray\n",
    "NumPy's array class is called `ndarray`. The following are some of the most important ndarray attributes:\n",
    "- `ndarray.dim`: the number of array's dimension (axes)\n",
    "- `ndarray.shape`: indicating the size of the array in each dimension. It is a tuple with n rows and m columns, `(n, m)`.\n",
    "- `ndarray.size`: total number of elements in the array. Equal to the product of the elements of `shape`.\n",
    "- `ndarray.dtype`: is an object describing the type of elements in the array. In NumPy, some examples are `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int64` and `numpy.float64`.\n",
    "- `ndarray.itemsize`: size in byte of each element in the array.For example, an array of elements of type `float64` has itemsize 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has itemsize 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to `ndarray.dtype.itemsize`.\n",
    "- `ndarray.data`: the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally, we wonâ€™t need to use this attribute because we will access the elements in an array using indexing facilities.\n",
